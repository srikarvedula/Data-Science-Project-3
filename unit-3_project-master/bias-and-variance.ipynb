Or, you could use this to estimate the degree of overfitting.\n",

You could also use this as a final step after the model is finalized (often called evaluating the model against a **validation set**).\n",

A dummy model is simply using the mean, median, or most common value as the prediction. This forms a benchmark to compare your model against and becomes especially important in classification where your null accuracy might be 95 percent.\n",
